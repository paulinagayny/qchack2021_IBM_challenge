"Mood Guessing Game"
A satisfability problem based on Groove's algorithm
Targeted audience: anyone who wants to play a simple guessing game for fun (age 5+)

Description:
1 person run the function with some conditions depending on his/her/their mood, for example
sad, angry 
setting also the number of probes run (it can be set randomly for more fun)
and then the same person reads the output mood state in front of other people (colleges), for example 
irritated, sad
Every participant decide what he thinks is true and what is not observing the person's expressions and behaviour
in this example the part about being sad is true, but the part about being irritated is not
for each good guess you get 1 point
finally the turn ends and next person does the same
After each participant's turns end a person with a highest score wins.

We can change the difficulty of the game by changing the number of qubits used - more qubits mean more possible mood states to guess from.

The probability of a good guess depends on our ability to perceive other people's emotions accurately, how good we are at it,
and guessing is by definition prone to errors.
the probability of assigning the words properly depends on the number of probes that we run
and it is never perfect even if we have a lot of probes (just as even if we have spent a lot of time studying humans
and we are good at it it doesn't mean we will always be right)

I wanted to make some parallel because I think it's more fun if we have one but of course it doesn't mean anything.

This simple game uses the interference and also uses the inaccuracy which comes with few probes (and growing accuracy with
more probes) as very important components.
